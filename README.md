# RokuKast

> A Chrome extension to stream web videos to Roku devices.

## Building

1. Clone repo
2. `yarn install`
3. `yarn dev` to compile once or `yarn watch` to run the dev task in watch mode
4. `yarn build` to build a production (minified) version

## Installation

1. Complete the steps to build the project above
2. Go to [_chrome://extensions_](chrome://extensions) in Google Chrome
3. With the developer mode checkbox ticked, click **Load unpacked extension...** and select the _dist_ folder from this repo

## Usage

The extension detects streamable videos (in **mp4** and **hls** formats) using two methods: searching the DOM for `<video>` tags and monitoring outgoing HTTP requests.

In order to use the Cast function, you must configure your Roku's IP address on the Settings page.

## Credits

This project is based on [RokuCast](https://github.com/pranav-prakash/RokuCast/) by Pranav Prakash and [chrome-extension-react-typescript-boilerplate](https://github.com/martellaj/chrome-extension-react-typescript-boilerplate) by Joe Martella.

## Headers
Looks like there are cases where video URLs will not load unless an expected origin header is present. Migth be able to send that header by passing HttpHeaders param to roku??
